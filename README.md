#### Ponytown preferences:<br>
C + H always okay! Please don't initiate prolonged RP unless I agree to it! Feel free to come up to me and give me a boop or hang out, especially if you have fandoms in common with me! I'm offtab like half the time, but just whisper and say hello! I am somewhat socially awkward, but who on pt isn't tbh.<br>
If we've talked a little or hung out for a couple minutes, feel free to give me a friend req!! I will pretty much always accept friend reqs.<br>
I usually will read someone's github or patreon if they have it linked so I know what their boundaries are! If I ever end up saying smth that makes you uncomfy, please tell me!<br> 

#### DNI criteria: <br>
Homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist, ableist, pedophile, Trump supporters, <br>
people who ship pedophilic or incestual things (not including selfcest) or support shipping such things<br>
If you're under 15, int with caution! I won't say don't int at all, but y'know.<br>
I don't support Vivziepop but I do watch her shows and enjoy them. Please don't int if you are one of those people who can't fathom seperating the art from the artist and will call me every name in the book for enjoying a damn show.<br>
IF YOU MAKE JOKES ABOUT SA I WILL PROB BLOCK YOU! THAT SHIT IS NOT FUNNY!<br>
Charlstor shippers and Narumayo shippers DNI... <br>
